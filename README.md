# Le Temps Passe (Time Goes By)

This animation is derived from [this code](http://xuv.be/leTempsPasse-timeGoesBy.html), originally written in [Processing](https://processing.org). That code is based on a sketch called “choose your planet” by a user with the name of *aniplastik*. It’s absolutely one of my all-time favorite Processing sketches.

Alas, the original sketch doesn’t work in a browser any more (unless you can support Java applets well), so I rewrote the code using the [p5.js](https://p5js.org) library. The original licensing is Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike, so I am using it as well.

Although the code works, I’m pretty sure I’m not using the delegation model for JavaScript objects in the best possible way. Oh well.
